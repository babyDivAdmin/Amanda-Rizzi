            <p id="para">Some summers I would spend visiting my Nana and Papa at their cottage "up north" which was in Lions Head,
                Ontario. There wasn't much else to do there but play board games, explore the woods behind her house 
                or visit the beach. When we weren't doing any of those I would find myself looking through her many books.
                 She had books from her native England that I had never seen before. One such book was about children that found a chair that could grow wings
                 and would often fly them off on grand adevntures. That is one of the first fantasy type books I think I 
                 ever read and one of only a handful of books I can remember reading in my childhood.</p>
